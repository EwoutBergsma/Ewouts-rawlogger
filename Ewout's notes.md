# Ewout's journey to Smartwatch data logging
First thing to decide on is which type of app we would like to use on our Garmin smartwatch(es). There are 5 types of apps, all designed for different types of usage. [Based on this information:](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/connect-iq-basics/app-types/#deviceapps)
* Watch Faces - Meant for showing time or other types of data, though this type of app is not allowed to utilize `Toybox.Sensor`. This appears to be a no-go for us, as that is exactly what we are interested in and I could not find a work-around (though, feel free to try and proof me wrong I am no expert in this). Which is a bummer, because Watch Faces appear to be the easiest type of app to run automatically after boot (by setting it as the default face). Also, as a side not, some Watch Faces (and Data Fields) do use sensor data, but get these through `Toybox.SensorHistory`, which disallows the sample rates we are interested in.
* Data Fields - The type of app that I understand least. Though, like the aforementioned app, it is disallowed to utilize `Toybox.Sensor`. Next.
* Widgets - Part of the carousel. In other words, this type of app can be found by scrolling up or down, thus requiring a small bit of effort to navigate to. This type of app is meant for quickly glancing at information. However,  [widgets timeout](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/connect-iq-basics/app-types/#widgets) after a short time. Which appears to be [unavoidable](https://forums.garmin.com/developer/connect-iq/f/discussion/5439/widget-app) as also [mentioned here](https://forums.garmin.com/developer/connect-iq/f/discussion/2356/widget-how-to-always-have-it-on-screen). 
* ~~Device~~ Watch Apps - Dubbed the most powerful app type (which is debatable). The only type of app that has access to `Toybox.ActivityRecording`; [the Activity Recording module will allow Apps to access the FIT file recording capabilities of the device](https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/api-docs/Toybox/ActivityRecording.html). Moreover, this type of app has access to `Toybox.Sensor`. User *jim_m_58* [mentions that he has made a Watch app](https://forums.garmin.com/developer/connect-iq/f/discussion/2356/widget-how-to-always-have-it-on-screen), for a similar usage as ours. The user appears to be an experience Garmin Developer.
* Audio Content Providers - Interestingly this type of app appears to compete with  the Device Apps for most supported modules. Though, it does not support `Toybox.ActivityRecording`, thus appears to be a no-go for our application.

In conclusion; Watch Apps is the only app that fits our needs.
